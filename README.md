# hello-world
This is my first *repository*
, i'm a student trying to learn to code in order to become an **MVP**

I started to use GitHub in order to complete some assignments from my classes in [IES Francesc de Borja Moll](http://www.iesfbmoll.org/)

For my assignment in LLMM i had to have a repositry with all this things:
  - Title
  - Lists
  - Links
  - Something written in bold and something written in italic
  - Code and Syntax Highlighting
  - Tables
